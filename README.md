### RESULT :

### 1. Straightforward Prompting

**Prompt 1:**  
Define Artificial Intelligence in healthcare in one sentence.

**Output:**  
Artificial Intelligence in healthcare refers to the application of machine learning and data analytics to assist in disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring.

**Prompt 2:**  
List three advantages of AI in medical diagnosis.

**Output:**  
1. Early detection of diseases  
2. Increased diagnostic accuracy  
3. Faster clinical decision-making  

**Evaluation:**  
This method provides clear, direct, and concise responses without additional explanation.


### 2. Tabular Format Prompting

**Prompt:**  
Compare Human Diagnosis and AI-Based Diagnosis in healthcare in tabular form.

**Output:**

| Parameters        | Human Diagnosis            | AI-Based Diagnosis              |
|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Speed            | Moderate                   | Very Fast                      |
| Accuracy         | Depends on experience      | High with proper training data |
| Data Processing  | Limited manual analysis    | Large-scale data processing     |
| Consistency      | May vary                   | Highly consistent              |
| Availability     | Limited working hours      | 24/7 availability              |

**Evaluation:**  
This method presents structured and comparative information in a clear tabular format.


### 3. Preceding Question Prompting

**Prompt:**  
Why is early disease detection important? How does AI support early diagnosis?

**Output:**  
Early disease detection is important because it improves treatment success rates and reduces medical expenses. AI supports early diagnosis by analyzing large datasets, identifying hidden patterns, and detecting abnormalities at an early stage.

**Evaluation:**  
This method generates logically connected and context-aware responses.


### 4. Missing Word Prompting

**Prompt 1:**  
AI systems analyze patient ____ to predict diseases.

**Output:**  
data  

**Prompt 2:**  
Machine learning models improve through continuous ____.

**Output:**  
training  

**Evaluation:**  
This method is useful for knowledge testing and assessment-based applications.



### Conclusion
